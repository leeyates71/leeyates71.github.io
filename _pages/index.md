This site will serve as the ePortfolio for my final project in CS-499 Computer Science Capstone.  The Self-Assessment 

## About Me
My name is Lee Yates.  I am in my last term at SNHU to complete my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.  I started back in this program in 2018, picking up where I left off over 20  years ago.  I have enjoyed the course material, learning multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++.  I have covered topics such as Software Test Automation, Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Development Lifecycle, and Object Oriented Analysis.  I am the proud father of 2 daughters, both of which are currently in college.  I have recently been blessed with the newest addition to the family in the form of a granddaughter.

## Future Plans
I have been working at my company for 27 years. I am currently the manager over a compute operations team, maintaining all AIX, Linux, and Windows systems for the company.  I enjoy the challenges and responsibilities of my current position.
