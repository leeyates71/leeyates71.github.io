My name is Lee Yates.  I am in my last term at SNHU to complete my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.  I started back in this program in 2018, picking up where I left off over 20  years ago.  I have enjoyed the course material, learning multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++.  I have covered topics such as Software Test Automation, Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Development Lifecycle, and Object Oriented Analysis.  I am the proud father of 2 daughters, both of which are currently in college.  I have recently been blessed with the newest addition to the family in the form of a granddaughter.  I have been working at my current company for 27 years and enjoy the challenges and responsibilities of my current position.
